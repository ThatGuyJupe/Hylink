I'm fairly new to this modding stuff as well as actually using Github, so please feel free to reach out to me here or on Discord (user: thatguyjupe) for questions or suggestions!

# Guide
This plugin utilizes Discord webhooks to send messages from your Hytale server to a Discord chat. To obtain a webhook URL, you must have Manage Channel permmisions of the Discord channel you are making a webhook for. Right click the channel > Edit Channel > Integrations > Webhooks > New Webhook. You can name it and set a custom profile for the webhook, then hit the copy link button.

On the Hytale server, you must have operator permisions. To link the chat, run /hylink link webhooklink. To unlink the Discord webhook, just use /hylink unlink.
